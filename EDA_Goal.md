# Goal of the EDA

The goal of this exploratory analysis is to understand **product
pricing, discount strategies, and availability trends** in the Zepto
dataset. Specifically, the analysis aims to answer:

1.  **Pricing Dynamics**
    -   How does the discounted selling price relate to the MRP?\
    -   Are discounts applied consistently across low-value and
        high-value products?
2.  **Discount Patterns**
    -   Which categories have the highest average discounts?\
    -   Are discounts driving significant price reductions, or are they
        mostly cosmetic (e.g., \~10--15%)?
3.  **Stock Availability**
    -   What proportion of products are out of stock?\
    -   Are some categories more prone to stockouts than others?
4.  **Category Insights**
    -   Which categories dominate the catalog in terms of product
        count?\
    -   Do specific categories show different discounting or pricing
        behaviors?

**In short:** The goal is to uncover insights into Zepto's pricing and
discount strategies, and to highlight stock availability trends across
categories.
